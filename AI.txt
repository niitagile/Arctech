					Artificial Intelligence

simulation of human intelligence

AI is based on Algorithms

Alogrithm writing

Machine Learning-- Neural Networks , Deep Learning

Most famous language for AI is python, Java

Maccine Language - R language

AI Tools and Framework
i)Scikit- Learn- Library. It is used for unsupervised learning..  It is expanded with python, numpy,, scipy
use for deep learning, data mining, Normal application of AI

ii) Tesnsorflow - google is using a lot, voice - acknoledgement application
iii) Caffe- It is implemented with google's deep dream , neural network, 

iv) mxnet-- framework for any language to create AI based s/w
v) pytorch-- facebook
vi)OpenNN-  Neuaral Designers
vII) Google ML - mobile developers


Salesforce
Tableau



Amazon services for AI
Amazon poly
sagemaker
Amazon Rekognition
Amazon Lex

				Machine Learning
Rapid increment in the production of data
Solving complex problems, which are difficult for a human
Decision making in various sector including finance
Finding hidden patterns and extracting useful information from data.


Classification of Machine Learning
supervised learning- sample labeled data is already saved in machine system
classification algorithms, regression algorithms  IBM Watson

unsupervised learning- machine tries to find out result from huge amount of data without any supervision.  
In Big data we use it to make group of similar type of data
algorithm- clustering and association

reinforcement learning- based on feedback and improve performances. Like google map



Neural network processing (NLP)


IOT- Internet of things (ML/AI)
Network infrastructure,cloud infrastructure,gateways,things

Image Processing
